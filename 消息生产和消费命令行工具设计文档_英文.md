## MainApplication

### Purpose

The `MainApplication` class serves as a command-line tool for interacting with topics in a messaging system. It allows users to produce and consume messages from topics.

### Methods

- `main(String[] args)`: The entry point of the application. Parses command-line arguments and processes the desired operation.
- `processCommandLineOptions(CommandLine cmd, Options options)`: Processes the parsed command-line options and delegates to appropriate methods for message production or consumption.
- `createOptions()`: Creates the command-line options configuration, including producer and consumer options, message content, topic name, master servers, and consumer group name.
- `printUsage(Options options)`: Prints the usage help message.

### Dependencies

- `MessageProducerTool`: Handles message production.
- `MessageConsumerTool`: Handles message consumption.



## MessageConsumerTool

### Purpose

The `MessageConsumerTool` class is responsible for consuming messages from a specified TubeMQ topic. It connects to the TubeMQ server, subscribes to the specified topic, and processes received messages.

### Methods

- `consumeMessages(String masterHostAndPort, String topic, String group)`: Consumes messages from the specified topic and group. It establishes a connection to the TubeMQ server, creates a message consumer, subscribes to the topic, and processes the received messages.
- `processMessage(byte[] messageContent)`: Processes a single received message by converting the message content to a string and printing it.

### Member Variables

- `messageProcessingThread`: A thread pool used for processing received messages concurrently.

### Dependencies

- `org.apache.commons.collections.CollectionUtils`: Utility class for operating on collections.
- `org.apache.inlong.common.msg.InLongMsg`: Represents the InLong message format.
- `org.apache.inlong.tubemq.client.config.ConsumerConfig`: Configuration for the TubeMQ consumer.
- `org.apache.inlong.tubemq.client.consumer.PushMessageConsumer`: Message consumer for receiving messages.
- `org.apache.inlong.tubemq.client.factory.MessageSessionFactory`: Factory for creating message session instances.
- `org.apache.inlong.tubemq.corebase.Message`: Represents a TubeMQ message.
- `org.slf4j.Logger`: Logger interface for logging.

### Method Details

- `consumeMessages(String masterHostAndPort, String topic, String group)`: Connects to the TubeMQ server using the provided master host and port, subscribes to the specified topic and group, processes the received messages concurrently, and shuts down the consumer after waiting for a certain period.
- `processMessage(byte[] messageContent)`: Processes a single received message by converting the byte array message content to a string and printing it. This method is called for each received message.

### Usage

1. Call the `consumeMessages` method with the master server's host and port, the topic to consume from, and the consumer group name.
2. Run the application to start consuming messages from the specified topic and group.

### Considerations

- Ensure that the required TubeMQ client library dependencies are correctly configured.
- The `consumeMessages` method handles the process of consuming messages from the specified topic. Modify the topic and group according to your needs.
- You can implement appropriate error handling or processing logic based on the message consumption result.

## MessageProducerTool

### Purpose

The `MessageProducerTool` class is responsible for publishing messages to a specified TubeMQ topic. It connects to the TubeMQ server, configures the client, and sends messages to the topic.

### Methods

- `produceMessage(String masterHostAndPorts, String topic, String message)`: Publishes a message to the specified topic. It establishes a connection to the TubeMQ server, creates a message producer, constructs a TubeMQ message, and sends it.

### Member Variables

None

### Dependencies

- `org.apache.commons.codec.binary.StringUtils`: Utility class for string and byte array conversion.
- `org.apache.inlong.tubemq.client.config.TubeClientConfig`: Configuration for the TubeMQ client.
- `org.apache.inlong.tubemq.client.producer.MessageProducer`: Message producer for sending messages.
- `org.apache.inlong.tubemq.client.producer.MessageSentResult`: Result of a message sending operation.
- `org.apache.inlong.tubemq.corebase.Message`: Represents a TubeMQ message.
- `org.apache.inlong.tubemq.corebase.cluster.MasterInfo`: Information about the TubeMQ master node.
- `java.time.LocalDateTime`: Represents a date and time.
- `java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter`: Formats dates and times.

### Method Details

- `produceMessage(String masterHostAndPorts, String topic, String message)`: Creates a `TubeClientConfig` object, connects to the TubeMQ server, creates a message producer, constructs a TubeMQ message, adds a custom system header, sends the message, and handles any errors.

### Usage

1. Call the `produceMessage` method with the master server's host and port, the topic to publish to, and the message content.
2. Run the application to send the specified message to the designated topic.

### Considerations

- Ensure that the required TubeMQ client library dependencies are correctly configured.
- The `produceMessage` method publishes the provided message to the specified topic. Modify the topic and message content as needed.
- Implement appropriate error handling or processing logic based on the message sending result.
